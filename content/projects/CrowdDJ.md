Developed a Composite Simpson’s Rule numerical integrator in MATLAB for a piecewise function with variable regularity. Performed a rigorous convergence analysis for different parameters, empirically determining the order of accuracy (p) and explaining how the smoothness of the integrand directly governs the convergence rate of the numerical method.
