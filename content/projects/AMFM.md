Conducted a comparative performance analysis of matrix inversion versus Cholesky factorization for solving large, sparse, symmetric positive-definite systems. Implemented algorithms in MATLAB to empirically determine computational complexity, validating theoretical expectations (O(n³) for inversion vs. ~O(n²) for Cholesky) through systematic benchmarking and data visualization.
