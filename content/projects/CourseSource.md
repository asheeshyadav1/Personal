Engineered a robust Newton’s Method solver in MATLAB to find roots of a complex transcendental function. Analyzed convergence behavior from different initial guesses, quantifying the order of convergence (α) and asymptotic error constant (λ) through iterative error computation, demonstrating both quadratic and divergent behavior.
