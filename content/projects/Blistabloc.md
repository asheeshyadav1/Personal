Designed and implemented the Jacobi iterative method from scratch in MATLAB to solve large, parameterized tridiagonal systems. Systematically analyzed the relationship between matrix size (n) and iteration count, determining the algorithmic scaling (O(nÂ²)) for different problem conditions and linking it to spectral radius theory.
