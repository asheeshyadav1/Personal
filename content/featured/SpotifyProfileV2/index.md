Developed a simple blockchain system in C that securely manages a sequence of blocks, ensuring tamper detection and data integrity using SHA-256 cryptographic hashing. Implemented custom functions to initialize a blockchain, add mined blocks, and verify block validity. Designed a mining mechanism that calculates a correct nonce by iterating through values until the block hash satisfies a given difficulty target. Leveraged timestamps, index tracking, and previous hash linking to maintain an immutable and verifiable chain. Integrated OpenSSLâ€™s libcrypto library to generate SHA-256 hashes efficiently and ensured compatibility with provided shared libraries. Extensively tested the system for nonce calculation, hash validation, and blockchain verification under varying difficulty levels.
